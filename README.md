# ai-buddy

A terminal command in Go that is an AI tool to help solving problems using a set of crowdsourced AI prompts.

It's heavily inspired by [Daniel Miessler](https://github.com/danielmiessler)'s tool [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric). I created this as a simplified Go version, that's compiled, and probably a bit faster.

It's currently using only Google Gemini API.

## Build and usage

To build and run the program, just run:

```sh
$ go build
$ go install
$ ai-buddy
```

## AI Models APIs

### Google Gemini API

For [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) API it's using the following models:

- gemini-1.5-pro
- gemini-1.5-flash
- gemini-1.0-pro

You can obtain your own API key and set an environment variable with it:

```sh
$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
```

Get your free API key at <https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>.

### OpenAI ChatGPT API

For [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) API it's using the following models:

- gpt-3.5-turbo
- gpt-4
- gpt-4o
- gpt-4-turbo

You can obtain your own API key and set an environment variable with it:

```sh
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
```

## Patterns

Patterns are crowdsourced curated special prompts that improve the quality of the model's response for a given request.

Take a look at the [./patterns](./patterns/) folder and check how they are created and work.

You can use the patterns directory in the same location of the binary, this is by default. Or you can set an environment variable if you want to move the binary to another directory. Set the environment variable: 

```sh
export AI_BUDDY_PATTERNS=<your_dir>/patterns
```

The current list of patterns was copied from the [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) project.

        ai-buddy -p summarize "Text to summarize..."
        ai-buddy -p summarize -m gemini-1.5-pro "Text to summarize..."
        ai-buddy -p summarize -m gpt-3.5-turbo "Text to summarize..."
        cat MyEssayText.txt | ai-buddy -p analyze_claims
        pbpaste | ai-buddy -p summarize | pbcopy
        cat text.txt | ai-buddy -p summarize -m gemini-1.5-pro

Commands:
        -m, --model <name>                     Specify the model name to use.
        -lm, --list-models                     List all available models.
        -p, --pattern <pattern_name> <prompt>  Specify a pattern and send prompt to model. Requires pattern name and prompt (also receive via pipe).
        -l, --list                             List all available patterns.
        -v, --view <pattern_name>              View pattern prompt. Requires pattern name.
        -h, --help                             Show this help.

Google Gemini API:
        - Get your API key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
        - Set an environment variable: export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>

OpenAI ChatGPT API:
        - Get your API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
        - Set an environment variable: export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>

Default model to use:
        - By default, the model "gemini-1.5-pro" from Google or "gpt-3.5-turbo" from OpenAI are used, depending on the API KEY entered.
        - But you can set a custom default model via an environment variable: export AI_BUDDY_MODEL=<model_name>

Patterns directory:
        - You can use the patterns directory in the same location of the binary (./patterns), this is by default.
        - Or you can set an environment variable if you want to move the binary to another directory.
        - Set the environment variable: export AI_BUDDY_PATTERNS=<your_dir>/patterns
```

# ai-buddy

A terminal command in Go that is an AI tool to help solving problems using a set of crowdsourced AI prompts.

It's heavily inspired by [Daniel Miessler](https://github.com/danielmiessler)'s tool [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric). I created this as a simplified Go version, that's compiled, and probably a bit faster.

It's currently using only Google Gemini API.

## Build and usage

To build and run the program, just run:

```sh
$ go build
$ go install
$ ai-buddy
```

## Google Gemini API

I used the [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) API and the model `gemini-1.5-pro` to send the prompts to be processed.

You will need to obtain your own API key and set an environment variable with it:

```sh
$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
```

Get your free API key at <https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>.

## Patterns

Patterns are crowdsourced curated special prompts that improve the quality of the model's response for a given request.

Take a look at the [./patterns](./patterns/) folder and check how they are created and work.

You can use the patterns directory in the same location of the binary, this is by default. Or you can set an environment variable if you want to move the binary to another directory. Set the environment variable: 

```sh
export AI_BUDDY_PATTERNS=<your_dir>/patterns
```

The current list of patterns was copied from the [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) project.

## Output

An AI tool to help solving problems using a set of crowdsourced AI prompts.

Example usage:
        echo "Text to summarize..." | ai-buddy -p summarize
        ai-buddy -p summarize "Text to summarize..."
        cat MyEssayText.txt | ai-buddy -p analyze_claims
        pbpaste | ai-buddy -p summarize | pbcopy

Commands:
        -p, --pattern pattern_name prompt  Specify a pattern and send prompt to model. Requires pattern name and prompt (also receive via pipe).
        -l, --list                         List all available patterns.
        -v, --view pattern_name            View pattern prompt. Requires pattern name.
        -h, --help                         Show this help.

Uses the Google Gemini API:
        - Get your API key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
        - Set an environment variable: export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>

Patterns directory:
        - You can use the patterns directory in the same location of the binary (./patterns), this is by default.
        - Or you can set an environment variable if you want to move the binary to another directory.
        - Set the environment variable: export AI_BUDDY_PATTERNS=<your_dir>/patterns
